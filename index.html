<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Hector Avalos. I have a wife and a 4 year old daughter, as well as 3 dogs. A little bit about me is that I enjoy numerous hobbies like video games, cars, and photography. I am taking this class because I intend on using the skills that I will learn in this class to build my own website to use as a portfolio for my photography. I want to become a professional photographer aside from my computer science career.</p>
